        <p>Cleaning concepts since the mid to late 90's<br>

          Cleaning concepts engrained in me over the years from my mother, scouts, my dad and brothers business Healthy Clean Unlimited, the Marines, and then when Healthy Clean Unlimited was handed over to me years ago.   Many years later, what started out as cleaning carpets and upholstery has only grown.   We took on lawn care that expanded into cleaning up and organizing homes outside and in. And now my knowledge and understanding of cleaning practices has now expanded into all aspects of life.   What used to be just a floor cleaning business has now stretched into understanding technology because tech is very much also a good part of the life that we are all living.   So having a clean home means so much more than just having clean floors, furniture and a clean yard.   We now consider all aspects of our living environment that includes our electronic devices.<br>

          Cleanliness has become a part of who we are.

        <p>Organizational practices since the 80's<br>

          In my early youth my mother taught me the value in having a neat, clean and organized bedroom.   Even though I have not always been very good at keeping my room clean, it is what I strive for from day to day.   I had even taken my knowledge of organizing to a new level years ago when I was hired on by Clutter Cutters to gut out homes and bedrooms in homes and garage spaces and clean and orgainize them.   As I grew in knowledge and experience I began taking on team members.   I tried to help my team make sure that they had everything that they needed to clean and organize and I even tried to help them know what we were getting ourselves into.   Those were some good times learning and growing as a team.   We now believe in having a house of order and cleanliness and strive for this in our own home which gives us the knowledge and understanding of how we can help others in achieving the same.

        <p>Security practices since the late 90's<br>

          What started out as simply watching over scouts during scout camp in my youth, turned into securing buildings while working for a security company in the late 90's and on to the Marines as a grunt securing a multitude of other things as I have learned security practices and improvements over the years.   I have been around the world securing vehicles, parking lots, boat ramps, people, ammunition...the list goes on.   And then even for my church I served as Temple security for the Kansas City Missouri Temple for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints when it first opened for it's open house.   I also served as building lockup and security for a Ward in Rexburg Idaho for a time.   And now I am learning to secure computers and help with internet security, also known as cyber security and information security.   Security is very much an important part of every day life....especially in our increasingly growing sketchy world that we are now living in today.<br>

          So as Master Yoda would say....<br>
          "May the force be with you!"

        <p>Have been in a state of prep &quot;since I was knee high to a grass hopper&quot;<br>

          Preparation for me started in the Scouts when I was in my youth.   Years later I joined the Marines where I took preparation to a whole new level.   Since then I have served as a youth leader for my church and have taken my knowledge from my entire life into family life.   We love the outdoors where we get to experience hiking, camping and overlanding.   We have felt that traveling and moving around has been helping us become better prepared.   We are not fully and completely prepared, but we are much closer now than we were 10 or more years ago. And the way we view preparedness is that we are in a constant state of prep and readiness because of how life randomly changes.

My work and hobbies consist of technology and becoming organized and prepared.  I love the knowledge that we are part of an Eternal Family and that we can turn to a God that loves us and wants us to succeed in life.  The Gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us to learn of all things both in Heaven and on earth and to become the very best version of ourselves.  And I have loved learning about myself and have found joy in serving and helping others in becoming such.
